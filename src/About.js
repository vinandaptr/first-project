            <p>We'll put a happy little bush here. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Let's make a happy little mountain now. You can spend all day playing with mountains.</p>

            <p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Put it in, leave it alone.</p>

            <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let's have a nice tree right here. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. We'll make some happy little bushes here.</p>
